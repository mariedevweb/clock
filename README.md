## Frontend
Open the client folder
Then you can use the following commands :
1- Project setup `npm install`
2- Compiles and hot-reloads for development `npm run serve`
3- Compiles and minifies for production `npm run build`
4- Run your unit tests `npm run test:unit`
5- Lints and fixes files `npm run lint`

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

## Backend
Open the server folder
Then you can use the following commands :
1- Project setup  `npm install`
2- Start server `node server.js`
3- Run tests `npm run test:watch`

## Project dairy
1- I started by installing the [Vue-CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) and setup the project following the pre-configured build setups.
2- For the backend part I chose to use node.js and express, so I followed the [installation instructions](https://expressjs.com/fr/starter/installing.html) and [\'Hello world\' exemple](https://expressjs.com/fr/starter/hello-world.html) from the express documentation to understand how express works and init my BE.
3- Then I followed [this website tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-make-secure-http-requests-with-vue-and-express/) to make my vue and express working together
4- After some reading to determine what framework I should use to do my unit tests I chose Jest, so i followed this [endpoint testing with Jest and Supertest tutorial](https://zellwk.com/blog/endpoint-testing/) to better understand how to write my tests
5- I made the template and styled it
6- The last step was to test the Frontend, so I did some more reading and tested many ways to test the vue components in my page. My solution is from multiple sources and several attempts

## Conclusion
I hope you'll be satisfied with the results I came up with :)

Thanks for taking interest in my work.
